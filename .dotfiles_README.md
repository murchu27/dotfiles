# dotfiles
A ***bare repository*** for my *nix dotfiles (i.e., config files)

## Setting up
As this is a bare repository, the set up is slightly different to a simple clone.

I followed the instructions [here](https://antelo.medium.com/how-to-manage-your-dotfiles-with-git-f7aeed8adf8b)
(TODO: transcribe these instructions to the README)
